  <md:title>More Probability: Homework</md:title>
  <md:abstract>This chapter covers additional principles of probability. After completing this chapter students should be able to: find the probability of a binomial experiment; find the probabilities using Bayes' Formula; find the expected value or payoff in a game of chance; find the probabilities using tree diagrams.</md:abstract>
